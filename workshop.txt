title=Controller Fishing Fix
description=Build 42.10.0 introduced controller support for fishing but I'm not happy with it since it only lets you cast out to 6 tiles, compared to the 16 tiles for mouse, and I find the right stick controls for reeling very awkward.

description=This mod has a custom implementation for selecting a casting location with the controller and allowing you to use the trigger buttons to real in your catch.

description=Controls:
description=With a fishing rod equiped in both hands start casting by aiming at water with the right stick and pressing RT.
description=Move the cursor with the DPAD and use the accept button to cast to the selected tile. The tile must be a tile with water on it.
description=Casting will also fail if the selected tile is out of range (approximately 16 tiles).
description=After casting use RT to reel in the line and LT to release the line. You can also use the vanilla controls and reel in by rotating the right stick.
